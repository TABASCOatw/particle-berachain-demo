  <h3>
    Particle Network Wallet-as-a-Service on Berachain
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing utilization of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service ([Particle Auth Core](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/core/web) in this case) on Berachain. This application facilitates social login and the execution of a sample (0.001 BERA or 1 HONEY) burn transaction alongside.

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
